## 📖 Introduction
Students often struggle in learning not due to lack of effort, but because of **hidden knowledge gaps** that go unnoticed. Traditional education systems follow a **one-size-fits-all approach**, which fails to address individual learning needs.

This project aims to solve this problem using **AI-driven personalization** to detect knowledge gaps and recommend tailored learning content.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
- One-size-fits-all education model  
- No early detection of learning gaps  
- Same content delivered to all students  
- Low engagement and poor learning outcomes  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
An **AI-powered personalized learning platform** that:
- Analyzes student learning data
- Detects individual knowledge gaps using ML models
- Recommends adaptive learning content
- Continuously improves recommendations based on performance

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Detect hidden knowledge gaps early  
- Provide personalized learning paths  
- Improve student learning outcomes  
- Increase engagement and confidence  

---

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Knowledge Graph Modeling**  
  Represents relationships between concepts and prerequisites.

- **ML-Based Knowledge Gap Detection**  
  Identifies weak concepts from student performance data.

- **Adaptive Content Recommendation**  
  Personalized videos, quizzes, and notes based on learner needs.

- **Progress Tracking Dashboard**  
  Visual progress reports for students and educators.
